Smart Contract Tutorial
=======================
a beginner's tutorial for creating and deploying a simple smart contract using the truffle suite



#### 1. Install Node.js
- If you don't have homebrew, [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and make sure it's on your `$PATH`
(if you run into problems with multiple versions, [download nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update))
- Or [use homebrew](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x)
